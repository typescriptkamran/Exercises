# exercise8
This TypeScript code is a simple script that outputs four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line, separated by lines of underscores for visual clarity. The purpose of using the `seperator` variable is to define a string containing underscores (i.e., "_") repeated 80 times, which acts as a separator between each line of output.

Here's the explanation of each part of the code:

1. `let seperator = "_"`: This line declares a variable `seperator` and assigns the string value "_" to it. The variable will be used to store the separator string containing underscores.

2. `console.log(seperator.repeat(80))`: This line outputs 80 underscores on the console. The `repeat()` method of the `seperator` string repeats the "_" character 80 times, creating a line of underscores.

3. `console.log(5 + 3)`: This line outputs the result of the arithmetic expression `5 + 3`, which is 8, on the console.

4. `console.log(seperator.repeat(80))`: This line outputs another line of 80 underscores on the console, acting as a separator between the previous output and the next one.

5. `console.log(16 - 8)`: This line outputs the result of the arithmetic expression `16 - 8`, which is 8, on the console.

6. `console.log(seperator.repeat(80))`: This line outputs another line of 80 underscores on the console.

7. `console.log(4 * 2)`: This line outputs the result of the arithmetic expression `4 * 2`, which is 8, on the console.

8. `console.log(seperator.repeat(80))`: This line outputs another line of 80 underscores on the console.

9. `console.log(16 / 2)`: This line outputs the result of the arithmetic expression `16 / 2`, which is 8, on the console.

10. `console.log(seperator.repeat(80))`: This line outputs a final line of 80 underscores on the console.

So, when you run this TypeScript code, you will see four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line, separated by lines of underscores for visual distinction.
