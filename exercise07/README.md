Sure! Let's go through the code step by step:

1. `let additionResult = 4 + 4;`
   Here, we are performing an addition operation by adding 4 and 4 together, which results in 8. The variable `additionResult` is assigned the value 8.

2. `console.log(`Addition Result: ${additionResult}`);`
   This line prints the result of the addition operation using the `console.log` function. The `${additionResult}` is a placeholder that gets replaced with the value of the `additionResult` variable. So, it will display:
   ```
   Addition Result: 8
   ```

3. `let subtractionResult = 16 - 8;`
   In this line, we are performing a subtraction operation by subtracting 8 from 16, which also results in 8. The variable `subtractionResult` is assigned the value 8.

4. `console.log(`Subtraction Results: ${subtractionResult}`);`
   This line prints the result of the subtraction operation using `console.log`. The `${subtractionResult}` placeholder is replaced with the value of the `subtractionResult` variable. So, it will display:
   ```
   Subtraction Results: 8
   ```

5. `let multiplicationResult = 4 * 2;`
   Here, we are performing a multiplication operation by multiplying 4 and 2, which once again results in 8. The variable `multiplicationResult` is assigned the value 8.

6. `console.log(`Multiplications result: ${multiplicationResult}`);`
   This line prints the result of the multiplication operation using `console.log`. The `${multiplicationResult}` placeholder is replaced with the value of the `multiplicationResult` variable. So, it will display:
   ```
   Multiplications result: 8
   ```

7. `let divisionResult = 16 / 2;`
   Finally, we are performing a division operation by dividing 16 by 2, which results in 8. The variable `divisionResult` is assigned the value 8.

8. `console.log(`Division Reslt: ${divisionResult}`);`
   This line prints the result of the division operation using `console.log`. The `${divisionResult}` placeholder is replaced with the value of the `divisionResult` variable. So, it will display:
   ```
   Division Result: 8
   ```

So, after running the entire code, the output will be:
```
Addition Result: 8
Subtraction Results: 8
Multiplications result: 8
Division Result: 8
```
